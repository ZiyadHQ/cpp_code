a display simulator program written in C style C++, you write to a byte array that represents a 2d canvas using simple APIs, it supports a 6bit RGB color and uses the last 2 bits for the glyph.
the program includes a simple verlet integration based physics solver demo.

use bash run.sh to run build and run the program, but it shouldn't be difficult since its only one source code file that needs to compile.
