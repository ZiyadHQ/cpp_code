people are not interchangeable parts

cant assume a task's timeline is fungible

communication:

55% is non-verbal(body language)

38% is in tone

7% is in the semantics

communication has many implicit factors(unknown or unannounced)



meetings:

dont take more time than needed

focus on the topic at hand, dont waste time with secondary topics



there must be an escalation mechanism when the capabilities of the
lower level management arent sufficient

escalation happens at the monitoring stage of the project

communication is a mean to an end

human communication is non-linear

strike a balance in meetings between forming new ideas and focusing on
an idea

can ther be high reward with low risk?
